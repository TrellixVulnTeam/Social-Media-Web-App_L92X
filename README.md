# Social-Media-Web-App

I am developing a Social Media Website which have all the features which a typical Social Media Website like Facebook and LinkedIn consists of.

Here are some key features of my social media app : 

 1. Provide free web space:  Members donâ€™t need to own or share web servers. They can publish their content on the free space provided by these sites.

 2. Provide free web address: Members are allotted a unique web address that becomes the web identity of an individual or a business. It can be used to identify, connect and share content.

 3. Ask members to build profiles: These sites require members to build their profiles. Information entered in the profiles is used to connect friends and contacts, and build networks that connect people with similar likes and interests across the world.

 4. Encourage members to upload content: These sites allow members to upload text messages, photographs, audio and video files. All posts are published in in descending order with the last post coming first. Most important, all content is published in real time, and can be read, viewed or shared instantly.

 5. Allow members to build conversations: Members can browse content and comment upon it. By doing so, social media sites allow members to engage in conversations that increase engagement.

 6. Allow live chats: Several social media sites have chat clients that enable members to chat with each other in real time.

 7. Direct Messaging facility: Several social media sites provide direct messaging facility to their members. This allows members to send private messages, which can be read or viewed only by those for whom the message is intended.

 8. Provide tagging alerts: Most social media sites alert members through e-mail or in site notifications whenever they are tagged in a message or in a photograph.
